## Overview

This web app allows users to discover random dog images, customize filters with a ban list, and view a history of previously seen items.

## Features

**Core Functionality**

- Clicking a button fetches random dog images and displays attributes from the API.
- Users can ban specific attributes, preventing similar images from being displayed.
- Only one image and its attributes are viewable at a time.

**Optional Features**

- Users can add multiple types of attributes to the ban list.
- Previously viewed items are stored and can be revisited.

**Additional Features**

- Duplicated attributes for the same image are prevented from being added to the ban list.
